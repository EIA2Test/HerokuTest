# HerokuTest
Test for node.js with Heroku
see how it works
Finally I probably managed to connect



Do:
- install EGit [necessary?]
- start new workspace with eclipse
- Import -> Git -> Projects from Git
- Clone URI
- Copy URI from GitHub and set username and password
- Select branch "master"
- Define destination: new folder in workspace
- select "import as general project"
- if needed: add .project to gitignore via Navigator



Checking other option:
- in new workspace
- open "Git Repositories" view
- Clone Repo
- Rightclick on Working Tree -> Import Projects -> Import Working Tree as general project
- work in "Project View"
- To commit/push:
-- rightclick on working tree in repo-view -> Add To Index
-- Changed files appear as Staged Changes
-- Commit And Push
